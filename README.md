# scripts

This is a loose collection of "scripts" that I have had use for, and that I want to keep around somewhere just in case.

PRs & issues are welcomed, so feel free to ask questions, request help, improve existing stuff (any form of documentation is especially welcomed<3), and point out flaws.
